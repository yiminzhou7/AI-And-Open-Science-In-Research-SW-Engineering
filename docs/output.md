The program generates the following outputs:

- A wordcloud figure representing the processed abstracts from the papers.
- A histogram figure representing the count of figures per article.
- List of links extrated from the PDFs.

The two figures are saved in the "**results**" folder and the list of links is shown on the terminal after running the main program.

# AI-And-Open-Science-In-Research-SW-Engineering
Repository for Artificial Intelligence and Open Science In Research Software Engineering deliverables

## Description
This project uses **Grobid**, a machine learning software, to extract structured metadata and content from documents in PDF format. The extracted information includes a word cloud with the keywords of the abstracts of the all documents, a bar chart showing the number of figures and the URLs that appear in each PDF document.

## Requirements
To run this program you will need:
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) which is a software that provides a convenient way to package, distribute and run applications as containers, ensuring consistency across different environments.
* [Grobid](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) which is a machine learning-based toolkit for extracting information from documents in PDF format. To run Grobid using Docker, you can use the official Docker image available on **Docker Hub**:
  ```
  docker pull lfoppiano/grobid:0.7.2
  ```

## Installation instructions
1. Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:
